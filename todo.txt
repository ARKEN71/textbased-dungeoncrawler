Very simple command-line game with RPG-ish elements. Due to simplicity, could consider adding networking eventually.

Basically runs like a state machine. Can be in "menu", "town" or "combat" states to give access to different commands, for example.

Starts with a main menu to create/load characters.

Once in game, there is a menu (which we will call "town") to do stuff like level up and change equipment. You can also choose to fight monsters.

Combat is turn-based. You can attack, cast <spell>, consume <item>, or run. On a victory, you earn exp and money to spend back in town.

todo: move everything out of main. oop-ify the game.
