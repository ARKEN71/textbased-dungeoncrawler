# C++ CLI RPG
### or C++ Command-Line-Interface Role-Playing-Game

It has a dumb name because I am bad at names.

Basically one evening I got home from work with a cool idea for a very simple game I could make with RPG mechanics, that wouldn't be too difficult to build and shouldn't take too much time to put together. Et voila! Here it is. I hope that other people find it fun for even just 5 minutes.
