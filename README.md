# C++ CLI RPG
### or C++ Command-Line-Interface Role-Playing-Game

It has a dumb name because I am bad at names.

Basically one evening I got home from work with a cool idea for a very simple game I could make with RPG mechanics, that wouldn't be too difficult to build and shouldn't take too much time to put together. Et voila! Here it is. I hope that other people find it fun for even just 5 minutes.

## License

GNU GPL v3. I feel like this is a simple little project that would be more useful being kept open and would be less useful as a basis for a large commercial project, so the GPL seems to fit well for this case.

## Dependencies

Requires: make and g++

## How To Build

```bash
$ cd src
$ make
$ ../bin/cpp-cli-rpg
```

## Contributing

Well, if you really want to, then OK. But I'd prefer no contributions just yet as I am still working on the basics, and kind of enjoying it! Once it's more fleshed out (and the code is way better) then I'll be more receptive to contributions, but currently there's just no point. Soon!
