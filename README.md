# TextBased-DungeonCrawler
### or A text-based dungeon crawler in C++

It has a dumb name because I am bad at names.

Basically one evening I got home from work with a cool idea for a very simple game I could make with RPG mechanics, that wouldn't be too difficult to build and shouldn't take too much time to put together. Here it is! After getting the minimal parts done, I've decided to keep adding to it a bit until I get bored.

## License

GNU GPL v3. I feel like this is a simple little project that would be more useful being kept open and would be less useful as a basis for a large commercial project.

## Dependencies

Requires: make, g++

## How To Build

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/techniman/textbased-dungeoncrawler.git
$ cd cpp-cli-rpg
$ make
$ bin/cpp-cli-rpg
```
