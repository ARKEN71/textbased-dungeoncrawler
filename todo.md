# To-Do
## Sooner
* add a shop in town
* add different kinds of creatures to encounter
* add extra locations to adventure to, with different sets of creatures
## Later
* add a system to read monsters from file, for easy configurability by players
* add a bounty board/minor quests
* add networking, maybe (need to think about how this would work)
