# To-Do
## Completed
* get it working
* make a nicer class-based structure
## High-Priority
* add a shop in town
* add different kinds of creatures to encounter
* add extra locations to adventure to, with different sets of creatures
## Low-Priority
* add a system to read monsters from file, for easy configurability by eager players
* add a bounty board/minor quests
* add networking, maybe (need to think about how this would work)
